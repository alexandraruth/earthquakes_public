# Mapping earthquake risks near U.S. embassies and consulates abroad

This was an analysis of earthquake risk at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad using earthquake data over the past ~50 years from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This analysis required scraping embassy addresses from the U.S. State Department webpage, geocoding embassy and consulate addresses using the Google Maps API, and constructing nearest-neighbor geospatial calculations of nearby earthquake counts to obtain Poisson probabilities of a severe earthquake event happening again within a certain number of years near each embassy or consulate. 
 
 The final map product that I developed showing earthquake risk at U.S. embassies and consulates and Poisson probabilities of a severe earthquake event occurring within specific distances for each embassy is located here:
